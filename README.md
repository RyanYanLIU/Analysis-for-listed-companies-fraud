# Analysis-for-listed-companies-fraud
#Background - Based on historical data, some companies ratings dropped off. I tagged them as "bad" companies for further step (They are potentially fraudelent as their ratings are lower than before) because I will build classification models based on this data.  
#Goal - Use this historical data and do prediction on unseen data. In other words, this model will help users detect what other companies (They are not in historical data) will be potentially fraudelent.
